                <article>
                    <h3>1. Long live nature!</h3>
                    <p class="width-800">Palawan is a treasure trove of natural wonders. Respect the environment by practicing responsible tourism. Dispose of your trash properly, avoid using harmful chemicals like sunscreen near coral reefs, and be mindful of your noise levels in protected areas. Remember, "Ingat ang kalikasan, para sa ating kinabukasan"</p>

                    <p class="width-800">The Philippines is a diverse nation with unique customs and traditions. Dress modestly when visiting religious sites, and be mindful of your body language in public spaces.
